This weather app provides you with temperature and weather details about the city you entered in the search bar.
It gets the weather data from -->

https://openweathermap.org/api

and displays it on the page. I have used "ejs" for rendering data dynamically.

## Steps to follow
First to install all dependancies run this command -->
    
    npm install
After finishing installing dependancies, Go to app.js and on line 13 where it says YOUR_API_KEY_HERE enter your own api key in single qoutes.

After doing this you can run command -->

    node app.js
to run the server.

You can check website at 

localhost:3000
